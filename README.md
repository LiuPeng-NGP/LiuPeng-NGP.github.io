I obtained my bachelor’s degree from **[Hebei University of Technology (HEBUT)](https://eweb.hebut.edu.cn/)** and previously served as a Research Assistant at **[Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/)**, where I was fortunate to be advised by **[Prof. Yaochu Jin]((https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html))**. 

My recent research interests include **AI Safety, Long Context Modeling, and Robotics**. I aim to pursue meaningful and impactful research, focusing on problems that are either under-explored or where I can offer a unique perspective.
